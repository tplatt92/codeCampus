<br>
codeCampus is a full stack application developed as a midterm project during the School of Code bootcamp. The aim of this project was to address a significant challenge faced by bootcampers: networking and organizing social events. Through extensive user research, we discovered that bootcampers often struggled to connect and arrange social activities effectively. To bridge this gap, we created codeCampus, a powerful solution leveraging web technologies and agile methodologies.

Problem Statement
<br>
Bootcampers face difficulties in networking and organizing social events, hindering their collaborative and social experiences during the bootcamp period.

Solution
<br>
codeCampus is a feature-rich web application designed to facilitate networking and social event organization among bootcampers. Using a tech stack comprising HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Vitest, we developed a user-friendly platform that connects like-minded individuals and fosters a sense of community.

Features
<br>
Event RSVP: Easily confirm attendance and view guest lists for upcoming events.
Organised Event feed: All networking events are in one centralised location.
Filtered Events: If you want to attend a certain type of event, the filter bar enables you to wittle down the feed to events the user wants to go to.
